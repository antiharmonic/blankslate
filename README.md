A blatant clone of blankslate.io because I wanted to change the colors dynamically.

Only uses localstorage (to store colors and text), so nothing ever hits the host.

To install: copy index.html wherever you want lol.

todo: change the <textarea> to an editable <div> because I'd like to be able to use bulleted lists and strikethrough
